There's a better way to do this.\n\nFor our development environment, we use MailCatcher.\n\n![](https://rocu.de/uploads/2021/2a02a849ba.png)\n\n> MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run MailCatcher, set your favorite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.\n\nIn this blogpost, I show you how we set it up in our projects.\n\nMailCatcher is a wonderful way to preview all the mails your Rails App sends in the development environment.\n\n## Installation\nAdd MailCatcher and Foreman to your `Gemfile` :\n\n\tgroup :development do\n\t  gem 'mailcatcher'\n\t  gem 'foreman'\n\tend\n\nRun `bundle install`.\n\nCreate a file named `Procfile`. This is used to start Rails and MailCatcher together with one simple command.\n\n\tweb: rails s\n\tmail: mailcatcher -f\n\nThe last step is to configure Rails to send emails to MailCatcher:\n\nAdd these 2 lines to your `config/environments/development.rb`.\n\n\tconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\n\tconfig.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: 'localhost', port: 1025 }\n\nNow you can run `foreman start` every time you want to start Rails.\n\nThis will start Rails and MailCatcher (which listens on port `1080`).\n\n## Using MailCatcher\n![](https://rocu.de/uploads/2021/c7ee9bb74f.png)\n\nEvery time Rails sends an email, MailCatcher will receive it and display it on at [http://localhost:1080/](http://localhost:1080/).\n\nYou can toggle between the HTML and the text portion of the email, and even inspect the source.\n\n## And what if I do not use Rails?\nGood news for you. You can also use MailCatcher without Rails.\n\n1. Just install MailCatcher via `gem install mailcatcher`\n2. Point your application to send mails via SMTP to port `1025`.\n3. Run `mailcatcher`.\n4. Go to [http://localhost:1080/](http://localhost:1080/).\n\n## Conclusion\nMailCatcher is one of these tools that we end up using whenever we start to send emails in a new project. I hope you like it as well.\n\n",

For example, your old car might need repair once in a while.</p>\n\n<p>More examples of expected rainy days:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You need to pay an insurance every year</li>\n<li>Christmas presents</li>\n<li>90th birthday of grandpa and you will need a flight</li>\n<li>Your ancient dishwasher might break</li>\n<li>Your house needs repair</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rainy days in this sense are not necessarily bad, but if you are not prepared, they can be really stressful.</p>\n\n<p>I love cruise vacations, for example. Sometimes they were (to) expensive for me. I didn&rsquo;t have all the money when I had to pay the bill. I was anxious and even sold some of my retirement nest-egg to pay the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Or you might use your credit card to pay for Christmas presents or the car repair. The next years you have to pay extra for this. Year after year. The tragic thing is: You should be able to finance these rainy days on your own, feel a lot better and save a ton of money in comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Hard to gain financial independence like this.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"unexpected-rainy-days\">Unexpected rainy days</h4>\n\n<p>The second type of rainy days is those bad moments in life. Moments that you did not anticipate — at all.</p>\n\n<p>These moments range from surprising to really hurtful, and some of them have the potential to ruin your families finances.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You get fired without notice</li>\n<li>A car hits you and you can&rsquo;t work</li>\n<li>One of your parents dies, and the funeral needs to be paid</li>\n<li>A relative is in real trouble and needs support</li>\n<li>You die (without any warning sign)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my young foolishness, I thought a long time that these rainy days are relatively unlikely to happen.

Add the name of the rainy day and how much money per month you think you need to be prepared.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t overthink this.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: you did not save for rainy days yet. The most important thing now is to just get started.</p>\n\n<p>Your estimations will get better and better over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: Christmas is in 6 months from now. Last year, you needed around $300 to cover all expenses. So $50 for Christmas it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Your car is old and might need repair. You have no idea when, you have no idea what it will cost. So, you guess $30 per month.</p>\n\n<p>Add up the amounts. The number is what you have to save for expected rainy days.</p>\n\n<p>Does it seem big? Unfortunately, you will still have to pay it if you save for it or not.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step-2-think-about-unexpected-rainy-days\">Step 2: Think about unexpected rainy days</h4>\n\n<p>Now I want you to think about unexpected rainy days.</p>\n\n<p>This might be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>What happens if you get so ill that you cannot work anymore?</p>\n\n<p>What if you get laid off tomorrow?</p>\n\n<p>Can you stay in the flat/house? Would there be enough money to keep the car?</p>\n\n<p>Against some of these risks, you need to insure.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you have a new house, a non-working wife, and 2 small children - what will they do if you die tomorrow?</p>\n\n<p>I will not cover insurances here.</p>\n\n<p>But please do yourself a big favor: Before you shop around for term life insurance educate yourself.
