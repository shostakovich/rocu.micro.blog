			 <p>Most thoughts are pointless. In the past, I thought, that I think my thoughts. But this is obviously untrue. Can you really stop thinking? Do you really have control over your thoughts? Or do thoughts just come and go, and you jump to the conclusion, that you are the thinker. Is the feeling of being the thinker just a function of the brain?</p>
<p><img src="https://rocu.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b05dfaf144.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If this sounds crazy to you, try out a 10-minute meditation and focus on your breath (try not to think). I can almost guaranty that you, that you will notice, that you have almost no control about your thoughts. And that most of them are not helpful. You try to relax and they distract you.</p>
<p>This is, of course, not a problem. Thought just bubble up all day. The problem starts, when you start to believe the thoughts and identify with them. If you concentrate on them, and you miss what is right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>What do I mean with it? Imagine you are taking a walk around a lake, and you think about work. You might have said something bad to a colleague. Now you can’t stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>A useful amount of thought would be something like „Ok — that was bad. I will apologize“. You can absolutely do it tomorrow. But not here at the lake. That&rsquo;s useful thought. But if your thoughts spiral into a carousel, and you play out potential conversations with your colleague, what you might have done better, that you hate your job, you might miss how beautiful the birds are chirping, that the sun is shinning and that, now, you cannot address the problem.</p>
<p>Most thoughts do not solve a problem. They do not help you with anything. They are completely useless and even might make you fell bad. Worst of all, they might rob your happiness.</p>
<p>Even „positive“ thoughts and daydreaming might be a waste of time because they also might filter out the pure joy of simply being. If you do not know what I mean, look at a small child, that discovers how wonderful the world is. How wonderful a leaf looks. Who enjoys rain and loves hoping into puddles.</p>
<p>The adult only thinks - oh damn it. It is raining and stays inside.</p>
<p>But the joy of the child is still available to every adult. It is just obscured behind a lot of thinking, that stops him to just see and feel what is really going on.</p>
<p>So, my goal is to recognize these thoughts and to concentrate on my surrounding. On my surroundings. On what I am doing.</p>
<p>Who cares if people do not vaccinate against Corona? Wo cares about that I need to run an errand tomorrow? I am baking a bread now :) My thoughts will distract me from the fresh smell. From kneading the dough. They are not really helpful to anyone.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I can undo all the years of habitual thinking. If I can be like a child again. But it is worth a try.</p>

<p>This was way worse than the first part of the &ldquo;murder mindfully&rdquo; series. A quite bizarre and unbelievable plot - which I like, but too much bashing of progressive world views. I mean I can laugh about some of the absurdities of wanting to fighting against climate change and living a hipster lifestyle. I can also laugh about mindfullness as a tool for success and even murder. After all  I am a mindfull hipster. But it&rsquo;s not enough to make up for the rest of the book.😮‍💨 Hope the next book is more entertaining.</p>

<p>A typical regional crime thriller. It&rsquo;s about German economic refugees in Vienna, many corpses. The book has a rather flat sense of humor. Not a special book and completely unrealistic, but I read it to the end and found it amusing.</p>

<p>to find the best in others;</p>
<p>to give of oneself;</p>
<p>to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,</p>
<p>a garden patch or redeemed social condition;</p>
<p>to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation;</p>
<p>to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived&ndash;</p>

			 <h2 id="1-nice-way">1. Nice way</h2>
<p>You can install an SSH key by executing</p>
<pre><code>ssh-copy-id user@servername.com

<p>Now you can log in to the remote server with your password and ssh-copy-id will do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="2-manual-way">2. Manual way</h2>
<p>Append your public ssh key to the <code>authorized_key</code> file on the server.</p>

<p>Both commands pretty much do the same. The first way is way easier though.</p>

			 <p>Do you know the feeling of copy and pasting the signup-link from this <code>development.log</code>? There&rsquo;s a better way to do this.</p>
<p>For our development environment, we use MailCatcher.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocu.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2a02a849ba.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run MailCatcher, set your favorite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that&rsquo;s arrived so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this blogpost, I show you how we set it up in our projects.</p>
<p>MailCatcher is a wonderful way to preview all the mails your Rails App sends in the development environment.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Add MailCatcher and Foreman to your <code>Gemfile</code> :</p>
<pre><code>group :development do
  gem 'mailcatcher'
  gem 'foreman'
end
</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>bundle install</code>.</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>Procfile</code>. This is used to start Rails and MailCatcher together with one simple command.</p>
<pre><code>web: rails s
mail: mailcatcher -f
</code></pre>
<p>The last step is to configure Rails to send emails to MailCatcher:</p>
<p>Add these 2 lines to your <code>config/environments/development.rb</code>.</p>
<pre><code>config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: 'localhost', port: 1025 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run <code>foreman start</code> every time you want to start Rails.</p>
<p>This will start Rails and MailCatcher (which listens on port <code>1080</code>).</p>
<h2 id="using-mailcatcher">Using MailCatcher</h2>
<p><img src="https://rocu.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c7ee9bb74f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Every time Rails sends an email, MailCatcher will receive it and display it on at <a href="http://localhost:1080/">http://localhost:1080/</a>.</p>
<p>You can toggle between the HTML and the text portion of the email, and even inspect the source.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-if-i-do-not-use-rails">And what if I do not use Rails?</h2>
<p>Good news for you. You can also use MailCatcher without Rails.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just install MailCatcher via <code>gem install mailcatcher</code></li>
<li>Point your application to send mails via SMTP to port <code>1025</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>mailcatcher</code>.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:1080/">http://localhost:1080/</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>MailCatcher is one of these tools that we end up using whenever we start to send emails in a new project. I hope you like it as well.</p>

			 <p>At our cooperative (<a href="https://techgenossen.de/">TechGenossen</a>) we used Gmail as our Email-Provider at first. But we found Gmail to be too expensive for our many members.</p>
<p>So, we decided to self-host our emails.</p>
<p>Setting up your email server can be quite hard and involves many moving parts. Fortunately, we found <a href="1">Mail-in-a-Box</a>, a fantastic open-source project, which helps you set up a mail server in no time.</p>
<p><img src="https://rocu.micro.blog/uploads/2021/bbec599ab9.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your mail service provider in a few easy steps. It’s somewhat like making your own Gmail, but one you control from top to bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh cloud computer into a working mail server. But you don’t need to be a technology expert to set it up.</p>
<p><em>Source: mailinabox.email</em></p>
<p><a href="1">Mail-in-a-Box</a> features an</p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP-Server</li>
<li>An easy to use Control-Panel</li>
<li>Nextcloud for contacts</li>
<li>Roundcube for webmail</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to set up on fresh Ubuntu 14.04. machine.</p>
<p><code>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/setup.sh | sudo bash</code></p>
<p>The software will guide you through the installation.</p>
<p>All you have to do is change some DNS-Records and voilà — it works out of the box.</p>
<p>As the admin of the server, you regularly receive emails about how to maintain the box.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the mail server and with the project.</p>

<p>Here is a skill that helps you to become financial independent, healthier, happier and helps you to grow as a person.</p>
<p>It is not very popular these days. But hey —  Common Sense these days makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>I am talking about insourcing.</p>
<p>Insourcing means taking your matters into your hand.</p>
<p>It means going for a daily walk, instead of taking those pills against high blood pressure.</p>
<p>It means cooking your own food, instead of running to the next restaurant.</p>
<p>It means to change a bad situation instead of complaining.</p>
<p>It means you stay at home with your children when they are small.</p>
<p>It means you clean your flat.</p>
<p>It means growing your own food. Organic, local, seasonal and fresh. You name it.</p>
<p>It means building your own items. Maybe even your own house.</p>
<p>It means when something breaks, you try to repair it.</p>
<p>It means before buying something new — you think about what item does nearly the same and use it.</p>
<p>It means you build the toys for your children — toys they will probably never forget.</p>
<p>You get the rough idea. Insourcing is simple.</p>
<p>Where do you insource already?</p>

			 <p>I discovered the secret how you can achieve your goals.</p>
<p>A secret that can change your life. Forever.</p>
<p>When we look at people who lost weight, at people who got rich, at happy people, at people who mastered a craft, we only see the results.</p>
<p>We see what they are now. And not the path that let them there.</p>
<p>We do not see the hours of hard work they put into it. The errors they made. The times they wanted to give up.</p>
<p>One reaction to this is to be overwhelmed. What they did, we cannot do…</p>
<p>The other reaction is to imitate them. But one has to fail it that if one only looks at the results.</p>
<p>So, now let me propose something different.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the small everyday steps.  Stick to them.</strong></p>
<p>Read the secret again. It&rsquo;s too easy to forget. It&rsquo;s not popular these days. It never was.</p>
<p>The reason is that going from A to B, one step at a time, does not look or feel glorious.</p>

<p>Energy and persistence conquer all things.</p>

<p>Small everyday decisions compound over time.</p>

<p>You invest $200 a month. It&rsquo;s easy to do for most persons. Also, easy not to do.</p>
<p>It will not make a big difference at first. You will hardly notice how your savings increase. You&rsquo;d rather keep the money.</p>
<p>But after 20 years, you will have saved $232.777,50. Here comes the fascinating part: Your investment will return $1370 per month. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Here comes the fascinating part: Your investment will return $1370 per month. More than you ever saved.</p>
<p>You could even stop saving at this point and have a fantastic retirement nest-egg.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Health** 
You go for a walk every day.</p>
<p>In your youth, you don&rsquo;t notice much. Just having some fun.  Enjoying the sun.</p>
<p>Down the road, walking has massive health benefits. Less risk for diabetes, lower weight, better mood and many, many more. It also saves a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Happiness** 
Boy Scouts do a good deed every day. Try it — not only will you make the world a better place to live, but you also will be happy.</p>
<p>Or say thank you to a colleague every day. This changes everything if you stick to it.</p>
<p><strong>The sky is not the limit:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind</p>
<p><strong>Neil Armstrong</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one step. For the one man.</p>
<p>It was billions of steps. Years of hard labor of thousands of men. Many mundane, seemingly insignificant things.</p>
<p>Culminating in the <strong>one step</strong> everyone sees.</p>
<h2 id="go">Go.</h2>
<p>I realize that all of this sounds unimpressive. After all, we all do small steps — right?</p>
<p>The problem is: there are 1000 good excuses for quitting. I don&rsquo;t see results. I don&rsquo;t feel well today. The weather is fantastic outside.</p>
<p>So one walks into different directions. No wonder it is overwhelming to come from A to B.</p>
<p>So <strong>stick</strong> to one direction and go. One small step. 5 minutes - it does not matter. Do not quit. No day off. No matter what. You will be surprised where it takes you.</p>

			 <p>Today, many products have only one use. Waffle irons, rice cookers, fondue sets, popcorn makers, toasters…</p>
<p>While many of these appliances are good at what they do — I do not use them regularly. They are wasteful.</p>
<p>I live in a small flat and I prefer not to waste money — so I love to have only a few items with multiple use.</p>
<p>They are essentials, versatile. You find many of them in every household. They are so common, that they are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Just a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>Knife</strong>: letter opener, vegetable slicer, garlic press, weapon, fruit peeler<br>
<strong>A big pot</strong>: rice cooker, water cooker, store food, a fryer, fondue, popcorn machine<br>
<strong>Paper</strong>: transports messages, packaging, insulation, for art, fire starter<br>
<strong>Vinegar</strong>: ingredient, insect catcher, descaler, cleaner<br>
<strong>Duct tape</strong>: Remember MacGyver?</p>
<p>Using items for different things requires you to learn small new skills — often these skills are learned faster than it would take to order a specialized appliance.</p>
<p>You are rewarded with a new skill, more money, more fun and more space in your life.</p>
<p>Before buying something new, I try to think about the stuff I own. Lots of stuff. With many, many uses.</p>
<p>Can I use these water bottles as weights? Aren&rsquo;t these books a nice stand for my notebook? Why not use this egg-carton to grow plants? This used box - great for my socks. Beat that IKEA.</p>

<p>Often I feel bad after watching an ad, reading an article about the next health gadget, after watching Apple keynotes or browsing on Amazon.</p>
<p>I feel like I have a hole in the stomach. I have to fight internal fights. Shall I buy the thing I didn&rsquo;t even know about a few minutes ago?</p>
<p>Often I loose and buy. Despite knowing better.</p>
<p>Worst of all — it became apparent to me that these holes in my stomach cannot be filled by stuff. They appear again and again and again.</p>

<p>Here is what I do since about a year - and it works quite well. I got rid of many ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlocker plugin</a> for your browser</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh">Block Amazon and other shopping sites</a> that you tend to browse</li>
<li>Prevent watching TV ads</li>
<li><a href="https://unroll.me/">Unsubscribe from all email-newsletters at once</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For all other ads: Try to catch yourself watching as them. When you catch yourself, go on with your life.</p>
<p>For example, I look at tobacco ads quite frequently. I have no idea why — I don&rsquo;t even smoke.</p>
<h2 id="ads-work">Ads work</h2>
<p>They work against your financial freedom. They work against your happiness.</p>
<p>Do not let them punch holes into your stomach and your purse.</p>

<p>How often do you get surprised by live and are not prepared?</p>
<p>How often do you use your credit card to pay for these little emergencies?</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will show you how to be prepared financially next time.</p>
<p>How next time the car breaks down it will be no financial catastrophe at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-2-types-of-financial-rainy-days">The 2 types of financial rainy days</h3>
<p>Let me first start with a little theory.</p>
<p>There are two types of rainy days: Those that you expect and those you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<h4 id="expected-rainy-days">Expected rainy days</h4>
<p>Occasionally you even know when a rainy day happens: You have to pay your expensive vacation in October.</p>
<p>For other rainy days, you do not know when they occur - but you can still anticipate them. For example, your old car might need repair once in a while.</p>
<p>More examples of expected rainy days:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to pay an insurance every year</li>
<li>Christmas presents</li>
<li>90th birthday of grandpa and you will need a flight</li>
<li>Your ancient dishwasher might break</li>
<li>Your house needs repair</li>
</ul>
<p>Rainy days in this sense are not necessarily bad, but if you are not prepared, they can be really stressful.</p>
<p>I love cruise vacations, for example. Sometimes they were (to) expensive for me. I didn&rsquo;t have all the money when I had to pay the bill. I was anxious and even sold some of my retirement nest-egg to pay the bill.</p>
<p>Or you might use your credit card to pay for Christmas presents or the car repair. The next years you have to pay extra for this. Year after year. The tragic thing is: You should be able to finance these rainy days on your own, feel a lot better and save a ton of money in comparison.</p>
<p>Hard to gain financial independence like this.</p>
<h4 id="unexpected-rainy-days">Unexpected rainy days</h4>
<p>The second type of rainy days is those bad moments in life. Moments that you did not anticipate — at all.</p>
<p>These moments range from surprising to really hurtful, and some of them have the potential to ruin your families finances.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get fired without notice</li>
<li>A car hits you and you can&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>One of your parents dies, and the funeral needs to be paid</li>
<li>A relative is in real trouble and needs support</li>
<li>You die (without any warning sign)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my young foolishness, I thought a long time that these rainy days are relatively unlikely to happen. Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>My father recently died, far too young. He prepared for this rainy day, very well, in fact. He spared us to worry about money in this very, terrible situation.</p>
<p>Also, getting laid off is always a possibility. There are no save jobs. Just look around.</p>
<p>Or you can certainly get too ill to work really, really fast.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-self-insure-against-most-rainy-days">How to self-insure against most rainy days</h3>
<p>Let me show you how to prepare for rainy days.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-make-a-list-of-expected-rainy-days">Step 1: Make a list of expected rainy days</h4>
<p>First, I want to make you a list of all expected rainy days. Add the name of the rainy day and how much money per month you think you need to be prepared.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overthink this.</p>
<p>Remember: you did not save for rainy days yet. The most important thing now is to just get started.</p>
<p>Your estimations will get better and better over time.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: Christmas is in 6 months from now. Last year, you needed around $300 to cover all expenses. So $50 for Christmas it is.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Your car is old and might need repair. You have no idea when, you have no idea what it will cost. So, you guess $30 per month.</p>
<p>Add up the amounts. The number is what you have to save for expected rainy days.</p>
<p>Does it seem big? Unfortunately, you will still have to pay it if you save for it or not.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-think-about-unexpected-rainy-days">Step 2: Think about unexpected rainy days</h4>
<p>Now I want you to think about unexpected rainy days.</p>
<p>This might be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>What happens if you get so ill that you cannot work anymore?</p>
<p>What if you get laid off tomorrow?</p>
<p>Can you stay in the flat/house? Would there be enough money to keep the car?</p>
<p>Against some of these risks, you need to insure.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a new house, a non-working wife, and 2 small children - what will they do if you die tomorrow?</p>
<p>I will not cover insurances here.</p>
<p>But please do yourself a big favor: Before you shop around for term life insurance educate yourself. Buy a good book on insurances. There is a lot of money to be saved. The book will page huge dividends!</p>
<h4 id="step-3-start-saving">Step 3: Start saving</h4>
<p>Time to automate your savings for your rainy day and emergency fund.</p>
<p>You need to save, monthly, the amount that you calculated for your expected rainy days plus something extra. As much extra as you can in fact. For now.</p>
<p>How big should your emergency fund (for unexpected rainy days) be? I recommend <strong>6 months worth of your monthly expenses</strong>.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do finish in one month or even a year. In fact, it is really unlikely that you can do it in this short of a timeframe.</p>
<p>But even $1000 in your emergency fund make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Put the money where you can access it fast. But don&rsquo;t keep it on your checking account. Rescue it from yourself, please!</p>
<p><strong>Without a budget</strong>: Start a savings plan and save <strong>automatically</strong>, directly after your paycheck arrives. The key is automatically. This is no decision you should think about every month.</p>
<p><strong>With a budget</strong>: Keep track of all the categories separately and save manually every month. This has the advantage of you knowing that you used too much money for car repairs and need to increase your savings a bit.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-never-forget-what-this-money-is-for">Step 4: Never forget what this money is for</h4>
<p>This is the hardest part. I definitely failed to do this, before I started to budget.</p>
<p>Do touch the expected rainy day money, when expected rainy day arrives.</p>
<p>Many rainy days <strong>will not be rainy at all</strong> if you planned for them.</p>
<p>Your emergency funds though are for emergencies only.</p>
<p>It makes sense to define what is an emergency and what is not an emergency in advance. Maybe write it down to remember.</p>
<h3 id="its-worth-it">It&rsquo;s worth it!</h3>
<p>Having an emergency fund feels great. It took me quite a while to fund mine, but I am not troubled about money anymore.</p>
<p>Many things that would otherwise be catastrophic won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>If I die, my loved ones have enough money to bury me.</p>
<p>If I get laid off, I have half a year to search for the perfect new job and am not forced to take the first offer.</p>
<p>The even bigger effect has the saving for the known rainy days.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, many of them are not rainy at all anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to pay the vacation? No problem. Not at all, I saved for months to be prepared.</p>
<p>The other thing you will learn is to save.</p>
<p>When you really manage to save 6 months in expenses only the sky is the limit. You obviously can save for retirement or for whatever you love.</p>
<p>I wish you less and less rainy days from now on dear reader and if you stand in the rain, that you at least have an umbrella with you.</p>

<p>Today, our society tends to move more and more towards specialization. You can buy everything prefabricated, and you are supposed to hyper-specialize in your job.</p>
<p>When it comes to your life, you should really consider if this makes sense for you.</p>
<p>Here are some examples, what we do on our own. Many examples are mundane — but that is just fine, considering that many people cannot boil an egg, without a special appliance.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-chefs">We are chefs</h2>
<p>Every morning, we stand in our kitchen and prepare a meal tailored exactly to our taste. Additionally, we have complete control over all the ingredients - which is great since we both are on a special diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheaper and healthier than to buy a meal every day — and best of all, cooking is a skill, and we are getting better and better.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-barbers">We are barbers</h2>
<p>Jupp. It probably doesn&rsquo;t look great, but this saves money and is relatively simple to learn.</p>
<p>For the ladies, this is probably a bigger challenge — but it should save you gals even more money.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-farmers">We are farmers</h2>
<p>We have a little garden and are starting to grow our food. I won&rsquo;t argue that this is cheaper in every case — it isn&rsquo;t — but It&rsquo;s great to do it.</p>
<h2 id="we-build--furniture">We build  furniture</h2>
<p>Some of our furniture is hand-made by us. You really don&rsquo;t have to buy every piece of furniture. It&rsquo;s wonderful to have some pieces custom-made by you.</p>
<h2 id="we-repair-our-devices">We repair our devices</h2>
<p>If a device is broken, we try to fix it. Occasionally this is beyond us — but often it works.</p>
<h2 id="what-has-this-to-do-with-early-retirement">What has this to do with early retirement?</h2>
<p>My point is — you don&rsquo;t have to buy everything. Use your money and save money to build the skills you want. You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect.</p>
<p>This is very rewarding.</p>
<p>As a retiree you will probably be very happy to be into knitting and soldering or to have acquired other new skills.</p>

<p>I love reading. When I was young, my parents heavily subsidized my book purchases. So, I formed a habit of buying a ton of books.</p>
<p>When I became a programmer, this started to become more and more costly. Every few days, the postman delivered my books.</p>
<p>When I started to budget and tried to invest money, I noticed that I spent between 100-200 Euros on books every month.</p>
<p>This means 18,000 Euros over ten years. Quite a big sum.</p>
<p>I managed to get my book related expenses down to 20 Euros per month with these tricks. Spoiler: They are obvious — but only in hindsight.</p>
<h2 id="the-library">The library</h2>
<p>Most of my non-technical books I get from our local library now. It has quite a wonderful assortment of great books. And: Every time I ask for them to buy a new one, they buy it for me.</p>
<p>I enjoy being there. It gives me a sense of community to share all these books with many people.</p>
<h2 id="used-books-and-selling-books">Used books and selling books</h2>
<p>For books that the library doesn&rsquo;t have, I buy used book over Amazon Marketplace. And after I read them, I sell them.</p>
<p>This makes even expensive books very affordable.</p>
<h2 id="my-employer">My employer</h2>
<p>For work related books, my employer is happy to order them for me. And I can give these books to my colleagues and have them at hand in our company&rsquo;s library.</p>
<h2 id="saving-is-not-about-sacrifice">Saving is not about sacrifice</h2>
<p>So, you see: I still love books. I read as many as before. I enjoy walks to the library — and all the book-loving people there.</p>
<p>I do not have shelf after shelf full of books at home — but that&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>
<p>I save a ton of money — and still enjoy reading.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of things, you have to watch out for — where you waste money, without improving your life.</p>

<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Reinhold Niebuhr (1892 – 1971)</em></p>
<p>Life is full of problems. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed? You can spend your whole energy and creativity on fixing them.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples that you might encounter as a programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your team does not test code</li>
<li>You want to use Git, but everyone else just feels fine with SVN</li>
<li>No department speaks to another one</li>
<li>Scrum sucks</li>
</ul>
<p>I had quite a hard time trying to fix all these things only a few years ago. It was quite impossible for me to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; these things in my team.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-try-to-change-people">Do not try to change people</h2>
<p>This is my advice: <strong>Do not try to change people.</strong></p>
<p>It sounds simple. But it isn&rsquo;t easy to do it.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-yourself">Start with yourself</h2>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<h4 id="example-1-everyone-else-uses-svn-and-you-want-to-use-git">Example 1: Everyone else uses SVN and you want to use GIT</h4>
<p>What you can change <strong>today</strong> is use <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html">git-svn</a>. It is not perfect, but you can commit as often as you like, squash commits and only push quality code into SVN.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to ask anyone. Just do it. Be patient and wait. Someday, some other colleagues might use GIT. Tell them about git-svn. Before long, you all might use GIT.</p>
<h4 id="example-2-your-team-does-not-test-code">Example 2: Your team does not test code</h4>
<p>And what about you? Do you really test-drive or test code? No? Then why not start now. You don&rsquo;t have to ask for permission. If you believe it&rsquo;s what professionals do, then do it. <strong>Today</strong>.</p>
<p>If there is a point to testing, then someone might notice. If there is no point to testing, you might notice.</p>
<h4 id="example-3-the-debarments-do-not-speak-to-each-other">Example 3: The debarments do not speak to each other</h4>
<p>Speak to another department. Invite a colleague that you don&rsquo;t know to lunch. Are you willing to do this? Are you willing to do this weekly?</p>
<p>Are there any colleagues that might be willing to do it? Can they join you? Ask them :)</p>
<p>Is there a question in your daily work, that only another department can answer? So, why don&rsquo;t you ask them?</p>
<p>This is something that you can do. <strong>Today</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-more-effective">Why is this more effective?</h2>
<p>You can act immediately on these problems. You do not have to ask for permission to change yourself.</p>
<p>Why waste any energy on stuff that you cannot do? It is absurd to change, if you think about it. It shows a lack of trust into your fellow programmers. Without trust, why should they follow you? You are not testing your code as well. You are not talking to other departments — why should they?</p>
<h2 id="change-yourself">Change yourself</h2>
<p>The things that you cannot accept in others, are a mere reflection of you. You cannot accept them because you haven&rsquo;t come to terms with yourself.</p>
<p>Try to change yourself.</p>
<p>You might not change the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; at all — but you will stop to be its victim. You will feel much better and, in the end you might be surprised, that the problem just dissolves over time.</p>
<p>After a few of these experiences, you might even notice, that the biggest problem might have been your perception of the &ldquo;situation&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-for-the-brave">This is for the brave</h2>
<p>Do not forget that changing oneself is only for the brave. It hurts to see that all the bad things that we think &ldquo;others&rdquo; do, we might actually do ourselves.</p>
<p>So be gentle to yourself :)</p>

			 <p>When I started to pair-programm I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I sat next to another programmer and we started. Occasionally it worked, but more often it was a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>Maybe you are new to pair programming and want to give it a try, or you have trouble getting started. Then this blog post is for you.</p>
<p>I show you how we pair at Gutefrage.net. Some of this advice is really obvious — but much of the other stuff we figured out the hard way through pairing over and over again.</p>

<h2 id="preparations-for-your-first-pairing-session">Preparations for your first pairing session</h2>
<p>Probably your workspace is not suited for 2 people working on it for an extended amount of time. So, before you even begin: Be a good host: <em>Adjust your environment for pairing.</em></p>
<h3 id="physical-preparation-of-your-workspace">Physical preparation of your workspace</h3>
<p>Move away the piles of paper, the dishes, and your backpack under the table. Clean your table. Don&rsquo;t let the navigator feel like he is just a visitor.</p>
<p>Now move 2 chairs in front of the table. If you do not pair all the time, it is also ok to keep a few spare chairs scattered through the office.</p>
<h3 id="prepare-your-hardware">Prepare your hardware</h3>
<p>Now take a good look at your screen(s). Can you see them from both perspectives? Is the contrast high enough?</p>
<p>Especially with notebook screens, it can happen that the person sitting next to you will have such a bad contrast that it might be hard for your pair to see what you are doing. If this is the case, get a monitor that both of you can watch.</p>
<p>Place a second mouse/keyboard combo on your desk. It&rsquo;s nice for the navigator to point to code or be able to write a chunk of pseudocode, and it costs nearly nothing.</p>
<h3 id="prepare-your-computer">Prepare your computer</h3>
<p>Adjust your font size to 16px or 18px. I know this seems ridiculously big, but it will be much nicer for the navigator to look at it. (And also for you, of course)</p>
<p>Now close all your programs. E-Mail clients, IRC, Instant Messenger are of-limits during pairing in my opinion. You will have time for checking this stuff in between the pairing session.</p>
<p>Prepare an editor/IDE that both of you can use. Get an environment ready that works, check out the project, run the tests.</p>
<h3 id="talk-to-your-partner">Talk to your partner</h3>
<p>You should know each other&rsquo;s schedule. I find it frustrating if my pair has to leave in 15 minutes. Better to know in advance.</p>
<h3 id="grab-essential-tools">Grab Essential tools</h3>
<p>Now the navigator should grab a <strong>notepad</strong> and a <strong>pencil</strong>. Also prepare a <strong>timer</strong>.</p>
<p>A kitchen timer works fine, alternatively search for &ldquo;<a href="%3Chttps://www.google.com/search?q=pomodoro+timer">Pomodoro Timer</a>&rdquo; on Google.</p>
<h2 id="immediately-before-every-session">Immediately before every session</h2>
<p>Grab a coffee, go to the restroom, and prepare yourself to focus for the next 25 minutes. Close open loops that might distract you during this time.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-pairing-session">The first pairing session</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each session, the navigator sets the timer to 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Then talk about what you want to do on a high level. Both of you should have a good idea about the scope of the task ahead and what steps are involved.</p>
<p>If the task consists of multiple steps, the navigator should write down a list off these steps.</p>
<h3 id="write-a-test-first">Write a test first</h3>
<p>Pick the best step to start with and write the first test. Try to get the test right, so you both understand what needs to be done.</p>
<p>TDD is especially effective with pairing, it communicates what you want to do, and it will focus both of you on the next step.</p>
<h3 id="driver">Driver</h3>
<p>Now the driver&rsquo;s responsibility is to implement the code. Explain what you are doing along the way. Do not concentrate that much on the big picture, but try to get the task at hand done. Trust your navigator to keep the larger picture in sight.</p>
<p>Whenever there are alternatives ways to do it, and you are not sure — ask your navigator what to do.</p>
<p>Let the navigator guide you through the list of tasks. Ask him how to proceed if you are unsure.</p>
<h3 id="navigator">Navigator</h3>
<p>Ensure that you work on the tasks on the list.</p>
<p>If you discover additional tasks — it often does make sense to postpone them and focus back on the problem at hand. It&rsquo;s your responsibility that both of you don&rsquo;t forget them — so write them down.</p>
<p>Keep engaged with the driver and try to understand what the driver does.</p>
<p>When you notice that the Driver get&rsquo;s stuck, unstuck him. Even if you don&rsquo;t know the answer to the problem at hand — ask him a question.</p>
<p>Point out typos or problems if the driver does not see them himself. Is the code understandable? Are the variable names ok? Is the class getting to bloated? Do an on-the-fly code review. Mention problems. But do not micromanage, of course. — Just like in a normal code review.</p>
<p>Pull the driver out of the implementation if you have the feeling that you should change the angle. Discuss it with him.</p>
<h3 id="talk-talk-talk">Talk, talk, talk!</h3>
<p><img src="https://rocu.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b02ccfb73a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>&ldquo;pio3/shutterstock.com&rdquo;</p>
<p>You should communicate all the time! In a good pairing session, it really feels like you are working on this in unison. As the driver you can focus on getting the tests passed and as the navigator you can keep the pair going in the right direction, ensuring an excellent quality.</p>
<p>Communicating right is maybe the hardest part for most programmers — just keep doing it. It&rsquo;s a skill that you can acquire and if the pair is really attuned to each other after many sessions this will feel like second nature to you.</p>
<h3 id="general-behavior">General behavior</h3>
<p>Concentrate on the task at hand for 25 minutes. Do not watch your emails, do not take breaks, try to stay engaged. It is expensive for 2 programmers to become distracted.</p>
<p>Work step by step from your list. After you have finished a step, take it off the list and start working on the next step.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t argue too much. This is not an ego game — if both of your solutions are equivalent, just decide and keep going ;)</p>
<h2 id="after-the-session">After the session</h2>
<p>The session ends after 25 minutes. Take a break of at least 5 minutes. This is the time to grab a coffee, to visit the restroom, check your mails and take a break.</p>
<p>Good pairing is intensive. You will need the break, especially if you want to work for a few hours in a pair.</p>
<p>After each pairing session, switch roles. We solve this with a WIP commit to the feature branch, then we change workstations.</p>
<p>After the break is over, start another pairing session if needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting started with pairing is no easy feat. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged. It is worth to learn it.</p>
<p>In a future blog post, I will describe the many problems that you might encounter during pairing and how to tackle them.</p>
<p>I hope after reading this little primer you get the idea how this could work and be sustainable. Since this are not best practices by any means, feel free to implement pairing your own way.</p>
<p>If you have experience pairing or tried this out: What are your thoughts about this? How do you pair?</p>

			 <p>I just finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781591843160">Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</a> by Seth Godin 📚. The book really strikes a chord with me.</p>
<p>Essentially it tells you why its a good idea to not only do your &ldquo;job&rdquo;. Why you should care to be an artist and why you should engage much more. It suggests that you have much more to offer than just being a cooperate drone.</p>
<p>It also talks about fear and hesitation. And why you should not listen to this kind of thoughts -<br>
just act on your ideas.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! Every other way of working is a waste of your time.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the book.</p>
<p>I made me stop and think about what I can contribute.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p><em>Castle 11 from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/billward/3393266991/">Bill Ward&rsquo;s Brickpile</a>. (CC BY 2.0)</em></p>
<p>Since quite a while, I try to find a good solution for sharing my dotfiles between my different computers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rocu.de/how-to-setup-your-mac-automatically-with-chef/">I started with chef</a> — Unfortunately, this did not work so well. Especially if you also want to use your dotfiles on a server. Also, it felt a little complicated.</p>
<p>The next approach I took was putting my dotfiles into my Dropbox and symlink them. This worked ok. But Dropbox on a server? No way.</p>
<p>So, I kept looking. A few days ago, I stumbled over<br>
<a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick">homesick</a> — an astonishing rubygem that manages your dotfiles.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>
<p>First install homesick:</p>
<pre><code>gem install homesick
</code></pre>
<p>Now create a &ldquo;castle&rdquo;. A castle is a collection of dotfiles.</p>
<pre><code>homesick generate ~/dotfiles
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a git repro with a /home folder inside. Just put your dotfiles / dotfolders in there. Then push the stuff to GitHub.</p>
<p>Now install the castle with homesick.</p>
<pre><code>homesick clone https://github.com/foo/dotfiles.git
</code></pre>
<p>Now let homesick do its magic.</p>
<pre><code>homesick symlink dotfiles
</code></pre>
<p>All the dotfiles from within this castle will be symlinked.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-wonderful">This is wonderful!</h2>
<ul>
<li>You feel at home at each of your servers in no time</li>
<li>You share your dotfiles with the world</li>
<li><a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">You can learn from others and refine your files</a></li>
<li>You can put essential little scripts into a .bin directory.</li>
<li>The castle concept allows you to try someone else&rsquo;s dotfiles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-word-of-caution">A word of caution</h2>
<p>Please do not put sensitive information into you dotfiles.<br>
Especially ssh keys, bash histories and passwords in configuration<br>
files do not belong on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="try-it">Try it!</h2>
<p>Seriously. It&rsquo;s magical. This is one of those things that you try out, and you ask yourself how you could possibly live without it.</p>
<p>Interested? Have a look <a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/dotfiles">at my dotfiles</a>.</p>

			 <p>From time to time, I really want to make it hard for me to seek for distractions.</p>
<p>I found myself using the nice Mac OS X tool <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> all the time. Freedom disables the network connectivity, which means no Twitter, Facebook etc.</p>
<p>But when I revisited the site, I found that the author now charges $10 for it - That&rsquo;s just a little too expensive in my opinion.</p>
<p>So, I went out, and it took me 5 minutes to come up with freedom.sh.</p>
<pre><code># !/bin/bash
echo &quot;Enough of this filthy internet&quot; | cowsay -s
sudo route -n delete default &amp;&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay">Cowsay</a> required. (If you prefer not to install cowsay just remove the line!)</p>
<pre><code>________________________________

</code></pre>
<p>To reenable your internet, you have to add back the default route or restart your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Little update (18.09.21):</strong> I do use <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> now. It got even more expensive - but it syncs between all my devices and changed from a internet kill-switch to something even more useful. I found it great to disable news sites and other addictive sites during corona.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://rocu.de/2021/09/02/lessons-from-the.html">Lessons from the prime factorization dojo</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://rocu.de/2021/09/02/lessons-from-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-09-29 17:22:00 &#43;0100">Sep 29, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week, my colleagues at Gutefrage.net, and I had our second</p>
<p>Coding Dojo.</p>
<p>I learned an important lesson — even though this wasn&rsquo;t the first time I practiced the kata.</p>
<h2 id="the-kata">The kata</h2>
<p>The task was to create a class that decomposes natural numbers into its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor">prime factors</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the factors should be sorted ascending.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>1  =&gt; \[] # Since 1 is no prime ;)
5  =&gt; \[5]
10 =&gt; \[2,5]
75 =&gt; \[3,5,5]
</code></pre>
<p>You get the idea ;)</p>
<p>This sounds simple and like a perfect candidate for an</p>
<p>Introduction to TDD, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kata is a bit tricky.</p>
<h2 id="performing-the-kata">Performing the kata</h2>
<p>The first tests are straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>module PrimeFactorDecomposer
  def decompose(number)
if number &lt; 4
    number
else
    [2,2]
end
  end
end

describe PrimeFactorDecomposer do
  include PrimeFactorDecomposer

  it &quot;returns no prime factors for 1&quot; do
    decompose(1).should be_empty
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 2 into 2&quot; do
    decompose(2).should be == [2]
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 3 into 3&quot; do
    decompose(3).should be == [3]
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 4 into 2,2&quot; do
    decompose(4).should be == [2,2]
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="now-the-trouble-begins">Now the trouble begins</h2>
<p>Now decomposing 5 would be a nice test? Right? Since 5 is a prime, it would only return 5. But how can we find out if it&rsquo;s a prime?</p>
<p>So, we could write a function that finds out if 5 is prime. Hm, that seems hard.</p>
<p>What about 6? But then we have to develop an algorithm that works — otherwise, we would just move sidewards and add conditionals.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What&rsquo;s the problem?</h2>
<p>You do not know how to solve the problem. Not everything is as simple as the <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz">FizzBuzz</a> Kata.</p>
<p>Adding another test alone does not suffice. It&rsquo;s a common hurdle for newcomers to TDD.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-solve-this">How to solve this?</h2>
<p>Grab a sheet of paper and think about the algorithm. Or do a little spike until you fully understand the problem. Every so often it&rsquo;s just not true, that a design &ldquo;magically&rdquo; emerges.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>You need sound knowledge about where to go — otherwise you will have problems with TDD along the way. Then you have to lean back and think a little or get feedback from something else than your tests.</p>
<p>TDD is cool, but it cannot solve every problem. Especially not complicated algorithms (this is a straightforward one, of course).</p>
<p>Another personal learning for me was to watch myself better, when I do a kata the first time.</p>
<p>When the design does not emerge from the tests — I should listen to them. Maybe they want to tell me that I have absolutely no idea what I am doing and that I need to think more…</p>

			 <p>I am quite excited about Avdi Grimm&rsquo;s new project <a href="https://www.rubytapas.com">Ruby Tapas</a>.</p>
<p>Three times a week, Avdi post short videos about different concepts and techniques in Ruby.</p>
<p>The first 3 episodes were short, but I already learned some obscure details of Ruby that I didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>I think that over many weeks, that should give me a pretty solid knowledge of the parts of Ruby that I do not touch in my daily work.</p>
