<p>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è A typical regional crime thriller. It&rsquo;s about German economic refugees in Vienna, many corpses. The book has a rather flat sense of humor. Not a special book and completely unrealistic, but I read it to the end and found it amusing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To laugh often and love much;</p>

<p>to win the respect of intelligent persons</p>

<p>to earn the approbation of honest critics</p>

<p>and to endure the betrayal of false friends;</p>

<p>to appreciate beauty;</p>

<p>to find the best in others;</p>

<p>to give of oneself;</p>

<p>to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,</p>

<h2 id="1-nice-way">1. Nice way</h2>

<p>You can install an SSH key by executing</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id user@servername.com
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can log in to the remote server with your password and ssh-copy-id will do the rest.</p>

<h2 id="2-manual-way">2. Manual way</h2>

<p>Append your public ssh key to the <code>authorized_key</code> file on the server.</p>

<p>As a one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@servername.com 'cat&gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys' 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both commands pretty much do the same. The first way is way easier though.</p>

<p>The next time you can connect to the server using your SSH key.</p>

<p>Do you know the feeling of copy and pasting the signup-link from this <code>development.log</code>? There&rsquo;s a better way to do this.</p>

<p>For our development environment, we use MailCatcher.</p>

<p><img src="https://rocu.de/uploads/2021/2a02a849ba.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run MailCatcher, set your favorite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1080">http://127.0.0.1:1080</a> to see the mail that&rsquo;s arrived so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this blogpost, I show you how we set it up in our projects.</p>

<p>MailCatcher is a wonderful way to preview all the mails your Rails App sends in the development environment.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Add MailCatcher and Foreman to your <code>Gemfile</code> :</p>

<pre><code>group :development do
  gem 'mailcatcher'
  gem 'foreman'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>Procfile</code>. This is used to start Rails and MailCatcher together with one simple command.</p>

<pre><code>web: rails s
mail: mailcatcher -f
</code></pre>

<p>The last step is to configure Rails to send emails to MailCatcher:</p>

<p>Add these 2 lines to your <code>config/environments/development.rb</code>.</p>

<pre><code>config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: 'localhost', port: 1025 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can run <code>foreman start</code> every time you want to start Rails.</p>

<p>This will start Rails and MailCatcher (which listens on port <code>1080</code>).</p>

<h2 id="using-mailcatcher">Using MailCatcher</h2>

<p><img src="https://rocu.de/uploads/2021/c7ee9bb74f.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every time Rails sends an email, MailCatcher will receive it and display it on at <a href="http://localhost:1080/">http://localhost:1080/</a>.</p>

<p>You can toggle between the HTML and the text portion of the email, and even inspect the source.</p>

<h2 id="and-what-if-i-do-not-use-rails">And what if I do not use Rails?</h2>

<p>Good news for you. You can also use MailCatcher without Rails.</p>

<ol>
<li>Just install MailCatcher via <code>gem install mailcatcher</code></li>
<li>Point your application to send mails via SMTP to port <code>1025</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>mailcatcher</code>.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:1080/">http://localhost:1080/</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>MailCatcher is one of these tools that we end up using whenever we start to send emails in a new project. I hope you like it as well.</p>

         	<p>At our cooperative (<a href="https://techgenossen.de/">TechGenossen</a>) we used Gmail as our Email-Provider at first. But we found Gmail to be too expensive for our many members.</p>

<p>So, we decided to self-host our emails.</p>

<p>Setting up your email server can be quite hard and involves many moving parts. Fortunately, we found <a href="1">Mail-in-a-Box</a>, a fantastic open-source project, which helps you set up a mail server in no time.</p>

<p><img src="https://rocu.de/uploads/2021/bbec599ab9.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your mail service provider in a few easy steps. It‚Äôs somewhat like making your own Gmail, but one you control from top to bottom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically, Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh cloud computer into a working mail server. But you don‚Äôt need to be a technology expert to set it up.</p>

<p><em>Source: mailinabox.email</em></p>

<p><a href="1">Mail-in-a-Box</a> features an</p>

<ul>
<li>IMAP-Server</li>
<li>An easy to use Control-Panel</li>
<li>Nextcloud for contacts</li>
<li>Roundcube for webmail</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to set up on fresh Ubuntu 14.04. machine.</p>

<p><code>curl -s https://mailinabox.email/setup.sh | sudo bash</code></p>

<p>The software will guide you through the installation.</p>

<p>All you have to do is change some DNS-Records and voil√† ‚Äî it works out of the box.</p>

<p>As the admin of the server, you regularly receive emails about how to maintain the box.</p>

<p>I am pleased with the mail server and with the project.</p>

<p>Here is a skill that helps you to¬†become financial independent, healthier, happier and helps you to grow as a person.</p>

<p>It is not very popular these days. But hey ‚Äî¬†¬†Common Sense these days makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>I am talking about insourcing.</p>

<p>Insourcing¬†means taking your matters into your hand.</p>

<p>It means going for a daily walk, instead of taking those pills against high blood pressure.</p>

<p>It means cooking your own food, instead of running to the next restaurant.</p>

<p>It means to change a bad situation instead of complaining.</p>

<p>It means you stay at home with your children when they are small.</p>

<p>It means you clean your flat.</p>

<p>It means growing your own food.¬†Organic, local, seasonal and fresh. You name it.</p>

<p>It means building your own items. Maybe even your own house.</p>

<p>It means when something breaks, you try to repair it.</p>

<p>It¬†means before buying something new ‚Äî you think about what item does nearly the same and use it.</p>

<p>It means you build the toys for your children ‚Äî toys they will probably never forget.</p>

<p>You get the rough idea. Insourcing is simple.</p>

<p>Where do you insource already?</p>

<p>Gaze at a flower and it is marvelous. ‚Äî¬†Look with a mental projection in your head, and you only see a representation. You look at the thought of a flower.</p>

<p>You could not accurately describe how a flower looks. How it smells with words. You have to go beyond thought. Beyond words.</p>

<p>I discovered the secret how you can achieve your goals.</p>

<p>A secret that can change your¬†life. Forever.</p>

<p>When we look at people who lost weight, at people who got rich, at happy people, at people who mastered a craft, we only see the results.</p>

<p>We see what they are now. And not the path that let them there.</p>

<p>We do not see the hours of hard work they put into it. The errors they made. The times they wanted to give up.</p>

<p>One reaction to this is to be overwhelmed.¬†What they did, we cannot do‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The other reaction is to imitate them. But one has to fail it that¬†if one only looks at the results.</p>

<p>So, now let me propose something different.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on the small everyday steps. ¬†Stick to them.</strong></p>

<p>Read the secret again. It&rsquo;s too easy to forget. It&rsquo;s not popular these days. It never was.</p>

<p>The reason is that going from A to B, one step at a time, does not look or feel glorious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Energy and persistence conquer all things.</p>

<p><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-small-steps-are-so-magical">Why small steps are so magical</h2>

<p>Small everyday decisions compound over time.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Money</strong></p>

<p>You invest $200 a month. It&rsquo;s easy to do for most persons. Also, easy not to do.</p>

<p>It will not make a big difference at first. You will hardly notice how your savings increase. You&rsquo;d rather keep the money.</p>

<p>But after 20 years, you will have saved $232.777,50. Here comes the fascinating part: Your investment will return $1370 per month. Not bad at all.</p>

<p>Here comes the fascinating part: Your investment will return $1370 per month. More than you ever saved.</p>

<p>You could even stop saving at this point and have a fantastic retirement nest-egg.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong>¬†Health**¬†
You go for a walk every day.</p>

<p>In your youth, you don&rsquo;t notice much. Just having some fun. ¬†Enjoying the sun.</p>

<p>Down the road, walking has massive health benefits. Less risk for diabetes, lower weight, better mood and many, many more. It also saves a lot of money.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong>¬†Happiness**¬†
Boy Scouts do a good deed every day. Try it ‚Äî not only will you make the world a better place to live, but you also will be happy.</p>

<p>Or say thank you to a colleague every day. This changes everything if you stick to it.</p>

<p><strong>The sky is not¬†the limit:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind</p>

<p><strong>Neil Armstrong</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one step. For the one man.</p>

<p>It was billions of steps. Years of hard labor of thousands of men. Many mundane, seemingly insignificant things.</p>

<p>Culminating in the <strong>one step</strong> everyone sees.</p>

<h2 id="go">Go.</h2>

<p>I realize that all of this sounds unimpressive. After all, we all do small steps ‚Äî right?</p>

<p>The problem is: there are 1000 good excuses for quitting. I don&rsquo;t see results. I don&rsquo;t feel well today. The weather is fantastic outside.</p>

<p>So one walks¬†into different directions. No wonder it is overwhelming to come from A to B.</p>

<p>So <strong>stick</strong> to one direction and go. One small step. 5 minutes - it does not matter. Do not quit. No day off.¬†No matter what. You will be surprised where it takes you.</p>

<strong>Paper</strong>: transports messages, packaging, insulation, for art, fire starter<br />
<strong>Vinegar</strong>: ingredient, insect catcher, descaler, cleaner<br />
<strong>Duct tape</strong>: Remember MacGyver?</p>

<p>Using items for different things requires you to learn small new skills ‚Äî often these skills are learned faster than it would take to order a specialized appliance.</p>

<p>You are rewarded with a new skill, more money, more fun and more space in your life.</p>

<p>Before buying something new, I try to think about the stuff I own. Lots of stuff. With many, many uses.</p>

<p>Can I use these water bottles as weights? Aren&rsquo;t these books a nice stand for my notebook? Why not use this egg-carton to grow plants? This used box - great for my socks. Beat that IKEA.</p>

<p>I do not read advertisements. I would spend all of my time wanting things.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Often I feel bad after watching an ad, reading an article about the next health gadget, after watching Apple keynotes or browsing on Amazon.</p>

<p>I feel like I have a hole in the stomach. I have to fight internal fights. Shall I buy the thing I didn&rsquo;t even know about a few minutes ago?</p>

<p>Often I loose and buy. Despite knowing better.</p>

<p>Worst of all ‚Äî it became apparent to me that these holes in my stomach cannot be filled by stuff. They appear again and again and again.</p>

<h2 id="getting-rid-of-ads">Getting rid of ads</h2>

<p>Here is what I do since about a year - and it works quite well. I got rid of many ads:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlocker plugin</a> for your browser</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh">Block Amazon and other shopping sites</a> that you tend to browse</li>
<li>Prevent watching TV ads</li>
<li><a href="https://unroll.me/">Unsubscribe from all email-newsletters at once</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For all other ads: Try to catch yourself watching as them. When you catch yourself, go on with your life.</p>

<p>For example, I look at tobacco ads quite frequently. I have no idea why ‚Äî I don&rsquo;t even smoke.</p>

<h2 id="ads-work">Ads work</h2>

<p>They work against your financial freedom. They work against your happiness.</p>

<p>Do not let them punch holes into your stomach and your purse.</p>

<p>How often do you get surprised by live and are not prepared?</p>

<p>How often do you use your credit card to pay for these little emergencies?</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will show you how to be prepared financially next time.</p>

<p>How next time the car breaks down it will be no financial catastrophe at all.</p>

<h3 id="the-2-types-of-financial-rainy-days">The 2 types of financial rainy days</h3>

<p>Let me first start with a little theory.</p>

<p>There are two types of rainy days: Those that you expect and those you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h4 id="expected-rainy-days">Expected rainy days</h4>

<p>Occasionally you even know when a rainy day happens: You have to pay your expensive vacation in October.</p>

<p>For other rainy days, you do not know when they occur - but you can still anticipate them. For example, your old car might need repair once in a while.</p>

<p>More examples of expected rainy days:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to pay an insurance every year</li>
<li>Christmas presents</li>
<li>90th birthday of grandpa and you will need a flight</li>
<li>Your ancient dishwasher might break</li>
<li>Your house needs repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Rainy days in this sense are not necessarily bad, but if you are not prepared, they can be really stressful.</p>

<p>I love cruise vacations, for example. Sometimes they were (to) expensive for me. I didn&rsquo;t have all the money when I had to pay the bill. I was anxious and even sold some of my retirement nest-egg to pay the bill.</p>

<p>Or you might use your credit card to pay for Christmas presents or the car repair. The next years you have to pay extra for this. Year after year. The tragic thing is: You should be able to finance these rainy days on your own, feel a lot better and save a ton of money in comparison.</p>

<p>Hard to gain financial independence like this.</p>

<h4 id="unexpected-rainy-days">Unexpected rainy days</h4>

<p>The second type of rainy days is those bad moments in life. Moments that you did not anticipate ‚Äî at all.</p>

<p>These moments range from surprising to really hurtful, and some of them have the potential to ruin your families finances.</p>

<ul>
<li>You get fired without notice</li>
<li>A car hits you and you can&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>One of your parents dies, and the funeral needs to be paid</li>
<li>A relative is in real trouble and needs support</li>
<li>You die (without any warning sign)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my young foolishness, I thought a long time that these rainy days are relatively unlikely to happen. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>My father recently died, far too young. He prepared for this rainy day, very well, in fact. He spared us to worry about money in this very, terrible situation.</p>

<p>Also, getting laid off is always a possibility. There are no save jobs. Just look around.</p>

<p>Or you can certainly get too ill to work really, really fast.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-self-insure-against-most-rainy-days">How to self-insure against most rainy days</h3>

<p>Let me show you how to prepare for rainy days.</p>

<h4 id="step-1-make-a-list-of-expected-rainy-days">Step 1: Make a list of expected rainy days</h4>

<p>First, I want to make you a list of all expected rainy days. Add the name of the rainy day and how much money per month you think you need to be prepared.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t overthink this.</p>

<p>Remember: you did not save for rainy days yet. The most important thing now is to just get started.</p>

<p>Your estimations will get better and better over time.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: Christmas is in 6 months from now. Last year, you needed around $300 to cover all expenses. So $50 for Christmas it is.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Your car is old and might need repair. You have no idea when, you have no idea what it will cost. So, you guess $30 per month.</p>

<p>Add up the amounts. The number is what you have to save for expected rainy days.</p>

<p>Does it seem big? Unfortunately, you will still have to pay it if you save for it or not.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-think-about-unexpected-rainy-days">Step 2: Think about unexpected rainy days</h4>

<p>Now I want you to think about unexpected rainy days.</p>

<p>This might be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>What happens if you get so ill that you cannot work anymore?</p>

<p>What if you get laid off tomorrow?</p>

<p>Can you stay in the flat/house? Would there be enough money to keep the car?</p>

<p>Against some of these risks, you need to insure.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a new house, a non-working wife, and 2 small children - what will they do if you die tomorrow?</p>

<p>I will not cover insurances here.</p>

<p>But please do yourself a big favor: Before you shop around for term life insurance educate yourself. Buy a good book on insurances. There is a lot of money to be saved. The book will page huge dividends!</p>

<h4 id="step-3-start-saving">Step 3: Start saving</h4>

<p>Time to automate your savings for your rainy day and emergency fund.</p>

<p>You need to save, monthly, the amount that you calculated for your expected rainy days plus something extra. As much extra as you can in fact. For now.</p>

<p>How big should your emergency fund (for unexpected rainy days) be? I recommend <strong>6 months worth of your monthly expenses</strong>.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do finish in one month or even a year. In fact, it is really unlikely that you can do it in this short of a timeframe.</p>

<p>But even $1000 in your emergency fund make a huge difference.</p>

<p>Put the money where you can access it fast. But don&rsquo;t keep it on your checking account. Rescue it from yourself, please!</p>

<p><strong>Without a budget</strong>: Start a savings plan and save <strong>automatically</strong>, directly after your paycheck arrives. The key is automatically. This is no decision you should think about every month.</p>

<p><strong>With a budget</strong>: Keep track of all the categories separately and save manually every month. This has the advantage of you knowing that you used too much money for car repairs and need to increase your savings a bit.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-never-forget-what-this-money-is-for">Step 4: Never forget what this money is for</h4>

<p>This is the hardest part. I definitely failed to do this, before I started to budget.</p>

<p>Do touch the expected rainy day money, when expected rainy day arrives.</p>

<p>Many rainy days <strong>will not be rainy at all</strong> if you planned for them.</p>

<p>Your emergency funds though are for emergencies only.</p>

<p>It makes sense to define what is an emergency and what is not an emergency in advance. Maybe write it down to remember.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-worth-it">It&rsquo;s worth it!</h3>

<p>Having an emergency fund feels great. It took me quite a while to fund mine, but I am not troubled about money anymore.</p>

<p>Many things that would otherwise be catastrophic won&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p>If I die, my loved ones have enough money to bury me.</p>

<p>If I get laid off, I have half a year to search for the perfect new job and am not forced to take the first offer.</p>

<p>The even bigger effect has the saving for the known rainy days.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, many of them are not rainy at all anymore.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to pay the vacation? No problem. Not at all, I saved for months to be prepared.</p>

<p>The other thing you will learn is to save.</p>

<p>When you really manage to save 6 months in expenses only the sky is the limit. You obviously can save for retirement or for whatever you love.</p>

<p>I wish you less and less rainy days from now on dear reader and if you stand in the rain, that you at least have an umbrella with you.</p>

<p>Today, our society tends to move more and more towards specialization. You can buy everything prefabricated, and you are supposed to hyper-specialize in your job.</p>

<p>When it comes to your life, you should really consider if this makes sense for you.</p>

<p>Here are some examples, what we do on our own. Many examples are mundane ‚Äî but that is just fine, considering that many people cannot boil an egg, without a special appliance.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-chefs">We are chefs</h2>

<p>Every morning, we stand in our kitchen and prepare a meal tailored exactly to our taste. Additionally, we have complete control over all the ingredients - which is great since we both are on a special diet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cheaper and healthier than to buy a meal every day ‚Äî and best of all, cooking is a skill, and we are getting better and better.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-barbers">We are barbers</h2>

<p>Jupp. It probably doesn&rsquo;t look great, but this saves money and is relatively simple to learn.</p>

<p>For the ladies, this is probably a bigger challenge ‚Äî but it should save you gals even more money.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-farmers">We are farmers</h2>

<p>We have a little garden and are starting to grow our food. I won&rsquo;t argue that this is cheaper in every case ‚Äî it isn&rsquo;t ‚Äî but It&rsquo;s great to do it.</p>

<h2 id="we-build-furniture">We build  furniture</h2>

<p>Some of our furniture is hand-made by us. You really don&rsquo;t have to buy every piece of furniture. It&rsquo;s wonderful to have some pieces custom-made by you.</p>

<h2 id="we-repair-our-devices">We repair our devices</h2>

<p>If a device is broken, we try to fix it. Occasionally this is beyond us ‚Äî but often it works.</p>

<h2 id="what-has-this-to-do-with-early-retirement">What has this to do with early retirement?</h2>

<p>My point is ‚Äî you don&rsquo;t have to buy everything. Use your money and save money to build the skills you want. You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect.</p>

<p>This is very rewarding.</p>

<p>As a retiree you will probably be very happy to be into knitting and soldering or to have acquired other new skills.</p>

<p>I love reading. When I was young, my parents heavily subsidized my book purchases. So, I formed a habit of buying a ton of books.</p>

<p>When I became a programmer, this started to become more and more costly. Every few days, the postman delivered my books.</p>

<p>When I started to budget and tried to invest money, I noticed that I spent between 100-200 Euros on books every month.</p>

<p>This means 18,000 Euros over ten years. Quite a big sum.</p>

<p>I managed to get my book related expenses down to 20 Euros per month with these tricks. Spoiler: They are obvious ‚Äî but only in hindsight.</p>

<h2 id="the-library">The library</h2>

<p>Most of my non-technical books I get from our local library now. It has quite a wonderful assortment of great books. And: Every time I ask for them to buy a new one, they buy it for me.</p>

<p>I enjoy being there. It gives me a sense of community to share all these books with many people.</p>

<h2 id="used-books-and-selling-books">Used books and selling books</h2>

<p>For books that the library doesn&rsquo;t have, I buy used book over Amazon Marketplace. And after I read them, I sell them.</p>

<p>This makes even expensive books very affordable.</p>

<h2 id="my-employer">My employer</h2>

<p>For work related books, my employer is happy to order them for me. And I can give these books to my colleagues and have them at hand in our company&rsquo;s library.</p>

<h2 id="saving-is-not-about-sacrifice">Saving is not about sacrifice</h2>

<p>So, you see: I still love books. I read as many as before. I enjoy walks to the library ‚Äî and all the book-loving people there.</p>

<p>I do not have shelf after shelf full of books at home ‚Äî but that&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>

<p>I save a ton of money ‚Äî and still enjoy reading.</p>

<p>These are the kinds of things, you have to watch out for ‚Äî where you waste money, without improving your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,</p>

<p>The courage to change the things I can,</p>

<p>And wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Reinhold Niebuhr (1892 ‚Äì 1971)</em></p>

<p>Life is full of problems. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed? You can spend your whole energy and creativity on fixing them.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples that you might encounter as a programmer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your team does not test code</li>
<li>You want to use Git, but everyone else just feels fine with SVN</li>
<li>No department speaks to another one</li>
<li>Scrum sucks</li>
</ul>

<p>I had quite a hard time trying to fix all these things only a few years ago. It was quite impossible for me to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; these things in my team.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-try-to-change-people">Do not try to change people</h2>

<p>This is my advice: <strong>Do not try to change people.</strong></p>

<p>It sounds simple. But it isn&rsquo;t easy to do it.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-yourself">Start with yourself</h2>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<h4 id="example-1-everyone-else-uses-svn-and-you-want-to-use-git">Example 1: Everyone else uses SVN and you want to use GIT</h4>

<p>What you can change <strong>today</strong> is use <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html">git-svn</a>. It is not perfect, but you can commit as often as you like, squash commits and only push quality code into SVN.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to ask anyone. Just do it. Be patient and wait. Someday, some other colleagues might use GIT. Tell them about git-svn. Before long, you all might use GIT.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-your-team-does-not-test-code">Example 2: Your team does not test code</h4>

<p>And what about you? Do you really test-drive or test code? No? Then why not start now. You don&rsquo;t have to ask for permission. If you believe it&rsquo;s what professionals do, then do it. <strong>Today</strong>.</p>

<p>If there is a point to testing, then someone might notice. If there is no point to testing, you might notice.</p>

<h4 id="example-3-the-debarments-do-not-speak-to-each-other">Example 3: The debarments do not speak to each other</h4>

<p>Speak to another department. Invite a colleague that you don&rsquo;t know to lunch. Are you willing to do this? Are you willing to do this weekly?</p>

<p>Are there any colleagues that might be willing to do it? Can they join you? Ask them :)</p>

<p>Is there a question in your daily work, that only another department can answer? So, why don&rsquo;t you ask them?</p>

<p>This is something that you can do. <strong>Today</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-more-effective">Why is this more effective?</h2>

<p>You can act immediately on these problems. You do not have to ask for permission to change yourself.</p>

<p>Why waste any energy on stuff that you cannot do? It is absurd to change, if you think about it. It shows a lack of trust into your fellow programmers. Without trust, why should they follow you? You are not testing your code as well. You are not talking to other departments ‚Äî why should they?</p>

<h2 id="change-yourself">Change yourself</h2>

<p>The things that you cannot accept in others, are a mere reflection of you. You cannot accept them because you haven&rsquo;t come to terms with yourself.</p>

<p>Try to change yourself.</p>

<p>You might not change the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; at all ‚Äî but you will stop to be its victim. You will feel much better and, in the end you might be surprised, that the problem just dissolves over time.</p>

<p>After a few of these experiences, you might even notice, that the biggest problem might have been your perception of the &ldquo;situation&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-for-the-brave">This is for the brave</h2>

<p>Do not forget that changing oneself is only for the brave. It hurts to see that all the bad things that we think &ldquo;others&rdquo; do, we might actually do ourselves.</p>

<p>So be gentle to yourself :)</p>

<p>It also talks about fear and hesitation. And why you should not listen to this kind of thoughts -<br />
just act on your ideas.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! Every other way of working is a waste of your time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocu.de/how-to-setup-your-mac-automatically-with-chef/">I started with chef</a> ‚Äî Unfortunately, this did not work so well. Especially if you also want to use your dotfiles on a server. Also, it felt a little complicated.</p>

<p>The next approach I took was putting my dotfiles into my Dropbox and symlink them. This worked ok. But Dropbox on a server? No way.</p>

<p>So, I kept looking. A few days ago, I stumbled over<br />
<a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick">homesick</a> ‚Äî an astonishing rubygem that manages your dotfiles.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>First install homesick:</p>

<pre><code>gem install homesick
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a &ldquo;castle&rdquo;. A castle is a collection of dotfiles.</p>

<pre><code>homesick generate ~/dotfiles
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a git repro with a /home folder inside. Just put your dotfiles / dotfolders in there. Then push the stuff to GitHub.</p>

<p>Now install the castle with homesick.</p>

<pre><code>homesick clone https://github.com/foo/dotfiles.git
</code></pre>

<p>Now let homesick do its magic.</p>

<pre><code>homesick symlink dotfiles
</code></pre>

<p>All the dotfiles from within this castle will be symlinked.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-wonderful">This is wonderful!</h2>

<ul>
<li>You feel at home at each of your servers in no time</li>
<li>You share your dotfiles with the world</li>
<li><a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">You can learn from others and refine your files</a></li>
<li>You can put essential little scripts into a .bin directory.</li>
<li>The castle concept allows you to try someone else&rsquo;s dotfiles</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-word-of-caution">A word of caution</h2>

<p>Please do not put sensitive information into you dotfiles.<br />
Especially ssh keys, bash histories and passwords in configuration<br />
files do not belong on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="try-it">Try it!</h2>

<p>Seriously. It&rsquo;s magical. This is one of those things that you try out, and you ask yourself how you could possibly live without it.</p>

<p>Last week, my colleagues at Gutefrage.net, and I had our second</p>

<p>Coding Dojo.</p>

<p>I learned an important lesson ‚Äî even though this wasn&rsquo;t the first time I practiced the kata.</p>

<h2 id="the-kata">The kata</h2>

<p>The task was to create a class that decomposes natural numbers into its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor">prime factors</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the factors should be sorted ascending.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>1  =&gt; \[] # Since 1 is no prime ;)
5  =&gt; \[5]
10 =&gt; \[2,5]
75 =&gt; \[3,5,5]
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea ;)</p>

<p>This sounds simple and like a perfect candidate for an</p>

<p>Introduction to TDD, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this kata is a bit tricky.</p>

<h2 id="performing-the-kata">Performing the kata</h2>

<p>The first tests are straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>module PrimeFactorDecomposer
  def decompose(number)
if number &lt; 4
    number
else
    [2,2]
end
  end
end

describe PrimeFactorDecomposer do
  include PrimeFactorDecomposer

  it &quot;returns no prime factors for 1&quot; do
    decompose(1).should be_empty
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 2 into 2&quot; do
    decompose(2).should be == [2]
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 3 into 3&quot; do
    decompose(3).should be == [3]
  end

  it &quot;decomposes 4 into 2,2&quot; do
    decompose(4).should be == [2,2]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="now-the-trouble-begins">Now the trouble begins</h2>

<p>Now decomposing 5 would be a nice test? Right? Since 5 is a prime, it would only return 5. But how can we find out if it&rsquo;s a prime?</p>

<p>So, we could write a function that finds out if 5 is prime. Hm, that seems hard.</p>

<p>What about 6? But then we have to develop an algorithm that works ‚Äî otherwise, we would just move sidewards and add conditionals.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-problem">What&rsquo;s the problem?</h2>

<p>You do not know how to solve the problem. Not everything is as simple as the <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz">FizzBuzz</a> Kata.</p>

<p>Adding another test alone does not suffice. It&rsquo;s a common hurdle for newcomers to TDD.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-solve-this">How to solve this?</h2>

<p>Grab a sheet of paper and think about the algorithm. Or do a little spike until you fully understand the problem. Every so often it&rsquo;s just not true, that a design &ldquo;magically&rdquo; emerges.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<p>You need sound knowledge about where to go ‚Äî otherwise you will have problems with TDD along the way. Then you have to lean back and think a little or get feedback from something else than your tests.</p>

<p>TDD is cool, but it cannot solve every problem. Especially not complicated algorithms (this is a straightforward one, of course).</p>

<p>Another personal learning for me was to watch myself better, when I do a kata the first time.</p>

<p>When the design does not emerge from the tests ‚Äî I should listen to them. Maybe they want to tell me that I have absolutely no idea what I am doing and that I need to think more‚Ä¶</p>
